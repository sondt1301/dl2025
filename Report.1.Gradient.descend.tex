\section{Implementation}
In order to implement a simple version of the Gradient Descend algorithm, there will be three functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Function f(x) returning x*x to represent f(x) = $x^2$
    \item Function f\_\_(x) returning 2*x to represent the first order derivative of f(x)
    \item Function gradient\_descend(L, x) to implement the main algorithm and print out x and f(x) per each iteration
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Variable L is the learning rate
        \item Variable x is the value of x
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Then, we call out the gradient\_descend function and pass in proper values of L and x.

\section{Learning rate effect}
In this particular function, with learning rate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $0 < l < 1$: f(x) keeps decreasing
    \item However, l = 0.5: f(x) always equals to 0 due to the derivative function 
    \item l = 1: f(x) does not change
    \item $l > 1$: f(x) keeps increasing
\end{itemize}
